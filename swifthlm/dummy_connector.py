This file implements SwiftHLM Dummy Backend Connector, a reference
implementation reusable for implementing a SwiftHLM Backend Connector for your
own HLM storage backend, which is considered backend-specific and external for
SwiftHLM. Any SwiftHLM Backend Connector implementation must implement
SwiftHlmBackendConnector class and its public method for SwiftHLM Generic
Backend API used between SwiftHLM and SwiftHLM Connector.

*** SwiftHLM Generic Backend API version 0.2.1 ***
(3 digits API versions, such version as 0.2.1, should be considered
developmental and not stable)

    response = SwiftHlmBackendConnector.submit_request_get_response(request)

request =
  {
  command : status,
  objects :
    [
      { object : /a/c/obj1, file : /srv/node/filepath1 },
      { object : /a/c/obj2, file : /srv/node/filepath2 }
    ]
  }

response =
  {
  objects :
    [
      {object : /a/c/obj1, file : /srv/node/filepath1, status : migrated,},
      {object : /a/c/obj2, file : /srv/node/filepath2, status : resident},
      {object : /a/c/obj3, file : /srv/node/filepath3, status : premigrated},
      {object : /a/c/obj4, file : /srv/node/filepath4, status : unknown}
    ]
  }

The deta structures used are dicitionary and list, the values are strings,
shown above unquoted and additinally indented for easier reading.

In addition to 'status', other requests are 'migrate' or 'recall' for which the
response is integer:
    0 - success
    1 - 1 or more objects could not be migrated/recalled
    2 - unable to process request for all objects (e.g. cannot invoke backend)

Internal methods of SwiftHlmBackendConnector are backend specific, and
typically involve reformatting the list of object and files to be migrated,
submitting the list and the operation to backend, and receiving response from
backend. Typically it is the backend that moves data between LLM (low latency
media) and HLM (hight latency media) and changes or reports replica state. For
other types of HLM backend the data move and state management function may be
implemented in the SwiftHLM Backend Connector of that backend.
